### 5. Commit Message Convention

This starter is using [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/), it is mandatory to use it to commit changes.


### App Router Update

Due to App Router update, the expansion pack is currently **outdated**. It will be updated in the future. You can still use them by copy and pasting the files.
